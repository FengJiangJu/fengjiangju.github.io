I am an incoming PhD student, specializing in Geophysics, at University of Southern California (USC) in America. My current research interests are the mechanisms of earthquake nucleation through observational studies and investigating the rupture characters, such as aspect ratios, of small to moderate earthquakes in dynamic simulations.

In my current research, I am working on two main projects: the location of immediate foreshocks and the analysis of rupture aspect ratios of small to moderate earthquakes in dynamic simulations. These projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in observational seismology and numerical modeling, and I am eager to expand my expertise in earthquake physics.

Looking ahead, I am particularly interested in pursuing research that integrates observational and simulation approaches to advance our understanding of earthquake sources. In the future, I plan to expand my research to Marine sciences, Volcanology and Life sciences by using geophysical and geological methods.
