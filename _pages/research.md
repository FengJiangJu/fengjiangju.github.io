Current Research
======

* **Observational Seismology**: I improve an algorithm based on beamforming and double-difference location, which can help to detect and locate more immediate foreshocks than template matching or machine learning based method when signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) are low. After immediate foreshocks of varying magnitudes and locations are detected, I study the cascade relationship between them and mainshock by calculating dynamic and static stresses. In addition, repeating earthquakes or waveform similarity is also one of the focuses in my research.

* **Dynamic Rupture Simulation I**: I simulate the rupture process of small earthquakes on both homogeneous and heterogeneous planar faults using the boundary integral equation method in order to explain the observed larger rupture aspect ratios. In the homogeneous case, our simulations exhibit rupture aspect ratios of less than 1.4. Consequently, we extend our analysis to faults with fractal heterogeneities, which indicate that spatial gradients in stress or slip-weakening critical distance can lead to a rupture aspect ratio greater than 1.9. Furthermore, I use the simulation results to statistically fit the observed rupture aspect ratios of actual small and medium earthquakes, constraining anisotropic heterogeneity on fault.

* **Dynamic Rupture Simulation II**: I am also investigating the relationship between large and small earthquakes by simulation and have found that, compared to the traditional focus on stress, nucleation area or connectivity might be more crucial factors.
  <!--These can cause a shift in the earthquake type, transitioning from a self-arresting rupture to a sub-shear rupture. Therefore, fault area and connectivity could serve as indicators to assess the likelihood of large earthquakes in a given region. At present, I am quantitatively assessing the impact of rupture connectivity.-->
